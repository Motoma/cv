                    <p>
                        My journey as an engineer began in the early 2000s, in what can only be described as a web 1.0 world. I 
                        cut my teath on LAMP-stack applications for various industries, including insurance, online education, and
                        plublishing. These early experiences gave me a solid engineering foundation and imbued me with a deep passion
                        for innovation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In 2012, I joined IDEXX where I stayed for a decade. I started as an individual contributor, but it was not
                        long before I was given the opportunity to lead teams and drive impactful projects. During my tenure at
                        the company, I was involved in the M&A process where I performed technical due diligence and led team-
                        building efforts for acquired projects. Starting with a 3-person core engineering team recruited from
                        within the company, I would build 15–20-person engineering teams to work alongside me. During this
                        period, IDEXX was named to the S&P 500, an index of the top 500 companies in the US economy and I was
                        leading development on its flagship software product.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My passion for innovation led me to explore blockchain technology early on. In fact, I was an early adopter
                        of Bitcoin, mining it in 2010-11. In 2017, I dove into Ethereum, Solidity, and dApp development and was
                        fascinated by the potential of decentralized applications to transform various industries. I was the driving
                        force behind the development of a Blockchain R&D department at IDEXX, where I led a team of 7 people
                        for 2 years and developed a chain of custody auditing protocol that reported to the USDA and FDA. During
                        this time, I gained deep expertise in the technical and operational aspects of blockchain technology and
                        helped others within the company understand this emerging paradigm-shift.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After realizing that enterprise blockchain was not going to take off I left the company, moving from a
                        10,000-person multinational corporation to a 20-person startup. There, I worked on the problems of on-
                        chain identity, KYC, AML, and the interplay of those for Sybil protection during on-chain token sales. I was
                        drawn to the startup environment, which offered more autonomy and opportunity to work on emerging
                        problems in cutting-edge technologies.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In February 2022, I met my co-founders of my current company, Elixir. After months of
                        brainstorming and whiteboarding, we were convinced that we could disrupt the centralized players in the
                        Market Making space. For the past year and a half, we have been working to build a revolutionary financial
                        primitive: decentralized algorithmic market making for central limit order books. As the CTO, I designed,
                        architected, and coded the first iteration of the protocol—a full DPoS network that performs algorithmic
                        market making on centralized exchange pairs. I built a team of 4 engineers, and we have successfully
                        launched 2 testnet releases, onboarded 10,000 validators, and completed a Series A fundraise at a $150m
                        valuation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As a technology leader, I bring a unique blend of technical ability, corporate business acumen, and
                        leadership skills to the table. I am a problem solver to my core, and I thrive in complex fast-paced
                        environments where the speed of innovation is the name of the game. I am truly passionate about
                        blockchains and their potential to transform industries and excited to bring my extensive experience to
                        the table.

                        <p>
                            Originally hired as a build automation contractor, I was brought on full-time in less than a year and grew
                            within the organization through multiple promotions, becoming the Technical Lead for two teams.
                            Instrumental in the acquisition of IDEXX Neo, building a team and bringing the product’s code up to
                            company standards. As the technical lead, I spearheaded process improvements and restructured the
                            team to increase the yearly release rate by a factor of 8x over two years while increasing reliability and
                            reducing defects. Working across the organization, and in close coordination with product, Neo became
                            the flagship Practice Information Management Software in the US, Canadian, and Australian markets.
